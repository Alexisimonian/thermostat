## Thermostat App

# How it Works
This thermostat-like software is a challenge from Makers Academy Bootcamp. With it, users can get the current temperature of any city and adjust a fake thermostat in consequence. <br><br>
The thermostat supports features like a "Power-Saving Mode" which prevents it from going over 25Â°C and color based warnings of current energy usage.

# Languages and libraries
The app has been made with JS, JQuery and Jasmine. I chose JS so that users don't have to refresh the page to use the app features.
To get information about current temperature of worldwide cities, the app connects to OpenWeather's API.
